### Remediation

#### Recommended Fix

Specific code or configuration changes:

```python
# Before (vulnerable)
user_input = request.get('input')
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}"

# After (fixed)
user_input = request.get('input')
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

#### Short-term Mitigation

If immediate fix is not possible:
- WAF rule to block attack pattern
- Disable affected feature
- Add monitoring/alerting

#### Long-term Recommendations

- Implement input validation framework
- Add security testing to CI/CD
- Security training for developers
